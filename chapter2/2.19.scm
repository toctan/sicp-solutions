;; Exercise 2.19

(define (cc amount coin-values)
  (cond ((= amount 0) 1)
        ((or (< amount 0) (no-more? coin-values)) 0)
        (else
         (+ (cc amount
                (except-first-denomination
                 coin-values))
            (cc (- amount
                   (first-denomination
                    coin-values))
                coin-values)))))

(define (first-denomination coin-values)
  (car coin-values))

(define (except-first-denomination coin-values)
  (cdr coin-values))

(define (no-more? coin-values)
  (null? coin-values))

;; The order of the list coin-values does not affect the answer.
;; Because no matter what the order is, the recursive call
;; (cc amount (except-first-denomination)) will iterate through
;; all the coins.
